# Self-Aiming-Cannon 

An autonomous, self-contained turret built for under $40 

## 🚀 Overview

Because it was done so cheaply, I used a **Raspberry Pi Zero** which could only process one image every few seconds. 
To get around the speed problem, I used socket communication 

## 🛠 Process

1. Stream the Raspberry Pi's video to a webpage.
   
2. Analyze the stream to find hand coordinates and gestures on an external computer.
   
3. Send hand coordinates and finger count data back to the Raspberry Pi.
   
4. Position the servos, activate the pump, and stop the pump when the ball leaves the barrel.
